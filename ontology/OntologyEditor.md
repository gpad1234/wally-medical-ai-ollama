Ontology editors are specialized software applications designed to create, edit, visualize, and reason over ontologies, usually employing languages like OWL, RDF, or SKOS. They allow users to define classes, properties, relations, and instances to model knowledge, with Protégé being the most common free, open-source tool, and WebProtégé a popular cloud-based alternative. 
Key Features of Ontology Editors:
Modeling Tools: Creation of class hierarchies, object properties, data properties, and constraints.
Reasoning: Support for reasoners to check for consistency and infer new relations.
Visualization: Tools often provide graphical, interactive diagrams to visualize complex knowledge structures.
Collaboration: Features that allow multiple users to edit and annotate vocabularies, often in web-based environments. 
Common Ontology Editors:
Protégé: A desktop-based open-source platform widely used in biomedicine and enterprise modeling.
WebProtégé: A collaborative, cloud-based version of Protégé.
Gra.fo: A visual tool specialized for rapid, collaborative modeling.
PoolParty: A commercial tool for managing SKOS taxonomies and RDF vocabularies.
FluentEditor: A tool that allows editing using Controlled Natural Language.
TopBraid Composer: A commercial environment for building semantic web applications.
Metaphactory: Provides a visual editor for defining, exploring, and managing knowledge graphs. 
These tools are crucial for organizing information in fields like artificial intelligence, clinical research, IoT, and data integration.
